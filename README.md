As part of the CODTECH Internship, Task 1 challenges the intern to create a static portfolio website using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This task focuses on building a clean, responsive, and professional digital portfolio that represents the developer's identity, skillset, and projects.

A portfolio website is an essential tool for any developer, especially early-career professionals or students. It showcases their technical skills, highlights their completed projects, and acts as a digital resume that is accessible to potential employers, clients, or collaborators.

The task requires the intern to build this website from scratch, without relying on pre-built website builders like WordPress or Wix. The purpose is to demonstrate fundamental front-end development skills.

The website should include the following core sections:

Home/Landing Page: A welcoming section with a professional image or animation, the developer’s name, a brief introduction, and call-to-action buttons such as “View Projects” or “Contact Me”.

About Section: A dedicated area providing background information about the developer—educational background, passions, goals, and an overview of their technical stack (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS, React, etc.).

Projects Section: Arguably the most important part of the portfolio, this section must display several personal or academic projects. Each project should include:

Project name and image/screenshot

Description and key features

Technologies used

Link to live demo (if available)

Link to GitHub repository

Skills Section: A structured and visually appealing display of technical skills, using icons, progress bars, or charts to show proficiency levels in various technologies and tools.

Contact Section: A simple contact form where visitors can send messages, or links to the developer’s email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and other professional networks.

Responsive Design: The website must be fully responsive and adapt well across all screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop. This can be achieved using media queries in CSS and flexible layout techniques like Flexbox or Grid.

JavaScript Enhancements: JavaScript should be used to enhance user interactivity—for example, smooth scrolling navigation, toggleable menus, dynamic project filtering, or form validation.

Deliverable:
By the end of the task, interns are expected to submit a fully working static website in a zipped folder or through GitHub. The site must be:

Fully responsive

Cross-browser compatible

Well-structured and documented

Free from broken links or errors

Learning Outcomes:
Through this task, interns will learn:

How to structure and style a professional-looking website

The basics of front-end development

The importance of responsiveness and accessibility

How to present themselves effectively online
